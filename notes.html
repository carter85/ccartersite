    Comparison Operators - Comparison Operators allow you to compare values and test whether a condition is met or not. Examoles incluse the greater than > an less than < symbols, and the double equals sign == which checks if two values are equal.

    Two components to a decison: 1. an expression is evaluated, which returns a value, 2. a conditional statement says what to do in a given situation
    
    var score = 7;
    
    if (score > 50) {
        document.write("You passed");
    } else {
        document.write("You failed");
    }
    
    == is equal to - compares two values (numbers, strings, or booleans) to see if they are the same
    
    != is not equal to - compares two values (numbers, strings, or booleans) to see if they are not the same
    
    === strict equal to - this operator compares two values to check that both the data type and value are the same
    
    !== strict not equal to - compares two values to check that both the data type and value are not the same
    
    > greater than - checks to see if the number on the left is greater than the number on the right
    
    < lesser than - checks to see if the number on the left is lesser than the number on the right
    
    >= greater than or equal to - checks to see if the number on the left is greater than or equal to the number or the right
    
    <= less than or equal to - checks to see if the nummber on the left is lesser than or equal to the number on the right
    
    Logical operators allow you to compare the results of more than one comparison operator.
    
    && Logical AND - operator tests more than one condition. If both expressions evaluate as TRUE, then the expression will return TRUE, if either returns FALSE, the entire operation returns FALSE.
    
    || Logical OR - operator tests at least one conditon. If either expression returns TRUE, then the expression returns TRUE.
    
    ! Logical NOT - operator takes a single Boolean value and inverts it, reverses the state of an expression. !(2<1) returns TRUE
    
    Short circuit evaluation - A strategy most programming languages use to avoid unnecessary work. If the first condition is enough to get an asnwer, there is no need to evaluate the second condition.
    
    If statement - The if statement evaluates (checks) a condition. If the condition evaluates to TRUE, any statements in the subsequent code block are executed.
    
    If..else statement - If else statements check a condition. If the condition is found TRUE, the code block is ran. If found FALSE, the code after the else is then evaluated, and so on.
    
    Switch statement - A switch statement starts with a variable called the switch value. Each case indicates a possible value for this variable and the code that should run if the variable matches that value. Using case for each new statement, followed by "break;" telling the code to stop executing.
    
    Type coercion - Type coercion is when Javascript converts data behind the scenes to complete an operation.
    
    Weak typing - Because the data type for a value can change, JS is said to have weak typing.
    
    Falsy - Falsy values are treated as if they were FALSE. Falsy values can also be treated as the number 0.
    
    Truthy - Truthy values are treated as if they were TRUE. Truthy values can also be treated as the number 1.
    
    Unary operator - A unary operator returns a result with just one operand.
    
    For loop - A for loop is used when code is needed to run a specific number of times.
    
    While loop - A while loop is used when you do not know how many times the code should run
    
    Do while loop - A do while loop works like the while loop except it will always run the statements inside the curly braces, even if the condition ecaluiates to false.
    
    break - Break is used to cause the termination of the loop and tells the interpreter to go onto the next statement of code outside the loop.
    
    continue - Continue tells the interpreter to stop the current iteration amd then update and chevk the condition again(if it is TRUE, the code runs again.
    
    Document Object Model(DOM) - The Document Object Model specifies how browsers should create a model of an HTML page and how JS can access and update the contents of a web page while it is in the browser window.
    
    DOM tree - The DOM tree specifies the way in which the browser should structure the model of the web page.
    
    Application Programming Interface(API) - API's let programs and scripts talk to each other.
    
    Document Node - The document node reperesents the entire web page, and is the first node in the DOM tree.
    
    Element Node - Element nodes describe the structure of an HTML page, such as h1 or /< p > tags.
    
    Attribute Node - Attribute nodes represent attributes contained in opening tags of HTML elements.
    
    Text Node - text nodes are contained within the element nodes, and cannot contain children.
