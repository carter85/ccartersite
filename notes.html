    <h3>Words to understand for chapter 1</h3>
    <p class="words">Script</p><p class="defs">A Script is a series of instructions that a computer can follow to achieve a goal. It can be compared to recipes, handbooks, or manuals.</p>
    <p class="words">Vocabulary</p><p class="defs">The words that computers can understand.</p>
    <p class="words">Syntax</p><p class="defs">How words are put together to create instructions a computer can follow.</p>
    <p>object</p><p>In computer programming, each physical thing in the world can be represented as an object.</p>
    <p>properties</p><p>properties describe the characteristics of an object. Each property has a name and a v</p>
    
    <p>Writing a Script</p>
    <p>To write a script, you need to first state your goal and then list the tasks that need to be completed in order to achieve it.</p>
    <p>A computer doesn't perform tasks like a person; it needs to follow instructions every time it performs a task, so a program must give the computer enough detail to perform the task as if every time were its first time.</p>
    <p>Start with the big picture of what you want to achieve, and break that down into smaller steps:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>>>Define the goal</li>
        <li>>>Design the script</li>
        <li>>>Code each step</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Designing a Script: Tasks</p>
    <p>>Once you know the goal of your script, you can work out the individual tasks needed to achieve it.</p>
    <p>Designing a Script: Steps</p>
    <p>Each individual task my be broken down into a sequence of steps. When you are ready to code the script, these steps can then be translated into individual lines of code.</p>
    <p>From Steps to Code</p>
    <p>Every step for every task shown in a flowchart needs to be written in a language the computer can understand and follow.</p>
    <p>Computers solve problems programmatically: they follow a series of instructions one after another.</p>
    <p>Defining a goal and defining the script</p>
    <p>Consider how you might aproach a different type of script. Details goals for the script. Break it into a series of tasks that have to be performed in order to achieve the goals.
    <p>Often scripts will need to perform different tasks in different situations. You can use flowcharts to work out how the tasks fit together. The flowcharts show the paths between each step. Arrows show how the script moves from one task to the next. Different shapes represent different types of tasks. In some places are decisions which cause the code to follow  different paths.
    <h3>>SUMMARY</h3>
<ul>
    <li>>A script is a series of instructions that the computer can follow in order to schieve a goal.</li>
    <li>>Each time the script runs, it might only use a subset of all the instructions.</li>
    <li>>Computers aproach tasks in a different way than humans, so your instructions must let the computer solve the task programmatically.</li>
    <li>>To aproach writing a script, break down your goal into a series of tasks and then work out each step needed to complete that task(a flowchart can help).</li>

Objects and properties
alue, and each tell you something about the object.


Events
An event is something that hapens on a computer that the computer can react to, such as a keypress or moving the mouse over an object.


Methods
Methods represent things that people need to do with objects. They can retrieve  or update the values of an objects properties. You do not always need to know how a method achieves a task, but you need to know how to ask the question and how to interpret any ansers ig gives you.


Web Browsers Are programs Built Using Objects
Web browsers create models of the web page they are showing and of the broswer window that the page is being shown in.


The Document Object Represents An HTML page
Using the document object, you can access and change what content users see on the page and respond to how they interact with it.

Like other objects that represent real worl things, the document object has:
>properties - properties describe characteristics of the current web page, such as the title.
>Methods - Methods perform tasks associated with the document currently loaded in the browser, such as getting information from a specified element or adding new content.
>Events - You can respond to events, such as a user clicking or taping on an element.

>Document Object Model(DOM) - When a browser creates a model of a web page, it also creates a new object for each element on the page, together these objects are described as the Document Object Model(DOM).


How A Browser Sees A Webpage
In order to understand how you can change the content of an HTML page using JS, you need to know how a broswer interprets the HTML code and aplies styling to it.

>1. Receive a page as HTML code.
>2. Create a model of the page and store it in memory. The model of a webpage can look like a family tree, at the top of which is a document object which represents the whole document. Beneath the document object, each object is stored in what is called a node. Each node represents another object, and these nodes are worked with to change objects in the DOM.
>3. Use a rendering engine to show the page on screen. If these is no CSS, the rendering engine will aply default styles to HTML elements. 

All major broswers use a JS interpreter to translate your instructions in JS into instructions the computer can follow.

>interpreter - The interpreter takes instructions and translates them into instructions the computer can use to achieve the tasks you want it to perform.

>interpreted programming language - An interpreted programming language, like JS, each line of code is translated one-by-one as the script is run.


SUMMARY
>Computers create models of the world using data.
>The models use objects to represent physical things. Objects can have: properties that tell us about the object; methods that perform tasks using the properties of that object; events which are triggered when a user interacts with the computer.
>programmers can write code to say "When this event occurs, run that code."
>Web browsers use HTML markup to create a model of the web page. Each element creates its own node (which is a kind of object).
>To make web pages interactive, you write code that uses the browser's model of the web page.
